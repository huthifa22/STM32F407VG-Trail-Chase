# Project Specifications 

This project implements a TrailChase game using an STM32F407VG microcontroller. The goal is to press the joystick button at the right time when an orange LED lights up just before the red LED in the incoming direction to increase the score. The game speed increases as the score increases. If the button is pressed at the wrong time, the game restarts.
